# Text

A simple `Text`. All text should be wrapped in this component for better compatibility with platforms that don't support text outside of tags, such as React Native.

`Text` accepts any component or strings as children.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Text>This is an example text.</Text>
  <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>This text is red!</Text>
  <Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>And this one is bold.</Text>
  <Text>There's a <Button>button</Button> inside this text!</Text>
</Playground>
